This was one of my first hikes in a while so it was pretty refreshing. It was relatively short compared to how long I usually walk but it was just so I could get back into the groove. I was walking alongside a river the entire time, the water was really soothing.

I first went over to the park and discovered some little buddies having a snack.
I decided to take a look but their parents didn't seem too happy about it.

After seeing those little guys, I kept going and didn't see anything interesting for a while. There were a lot of people biking but that's to be expected when you're in Germany.


Next I found this beautiful river (my terrible photography skills do it no justice.) I was really tempted to just skip over the rocks onto the tiny island in the middle of the river. That dream lasted for as long as it took me to realize that my fitness level is capped at lifting heavy things and walking, not jumping on giant rocks.

I did take a short break here, just relaxed and took in the scenery.


As I was nearing the half-point of my hike, I had to cross a bridge over that same river. Once I got across I realized there was a nice stairway going underneath the bridge. Of course, my curious self went down there. I'll have you know, I didn't regret it.

I wholeheartedly agree with the vandalism.


As I was walking I found a little, hidden, trail going down to the side of another small river. I checked it out and found this amazing patch of greenery and nice view. Though, it was quite muddy.

I found this cute little tower I climbed on and found a really beautiful view of the river. One part was smooth and calm, almost like glass. The other part was splashing all around and super messy. It looked pretty awesome.

Near the end of the hike, I was walking throught a patch of grass and ended up here. It was really nice since there were absolutely 0 people around.
