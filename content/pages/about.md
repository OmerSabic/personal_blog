Hello world! My name is Omer.

I'm an 18 year old student in Germany. 
I was born and raised in Bosnia but moved to Germany in 2021 to advance my career and education.


Some of my hobbies include:
* Hiking
* Chess
* Programming
* Weight Lifting
* Reading


The website you're on right now is just meant as a personal space for me to share what I do on a daily basis.
I'll write about the books I've been reading, sharing some new things I've learned, showing off my achievements and more.

I don't really have any social media so this is as close as it gets! :D
